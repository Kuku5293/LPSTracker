# LPSTracker
Device level time tracker

The idea of this tracker is to track the time on mobile device which runs globally. User can start the tracker from the timer button in header.
The tracker would be running when the app is in background also even if the app is removed from the background, you can track the lapsed time once you open the app.
Here you can stop the timer when app is removed from the background as per your requirements.
The timer can be stopped by tapping on the red bar of the screen.
